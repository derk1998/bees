Last week, we created the first version of the business model canvas for InsectSense. We retrieved the information from the [website](https://insectsense.com) of InsectSense. Since the company is in a starting up phase, there is limited information available.

The first version of the business model canvas (in Dutch):

We realized that we missed a lot of information and decided to send an e-mail to Aria (founder of InsectSense). The following questions were asked:

1. InsectSense makes use of the StartHub program, with which we are not familiar. What does StartHub offer for a company like InsectSense? For instance, does StartHub also offer free/cheaper workplaces/offices, or do you benefit from having workshops offered by StartHub?
2. Since InsectSense is a company, it also needs revenue streams to keep running. Do you receive any subsidies from the Dutch Government, or does InsectSense have investors?
3. We would like to ask if you can make use of the equipment at Wageningen University. Do you have access to the labs, professors, maybe the help of students?

We got the following answers, but haven't made a new version of the business model canvas yet:

1. Starthub is the incubator of Wageningen UR and provides cheap office and pool of mentors and advisers for startups.
2. InsectSense is an early stage startup and is not generating any revenue at this stage, but there are some companies who are interested in the service of InsectSense and we are hopeful to go to the market soon.
3. We are applying for R&D and feasibility study grants from NOW which enables us to do research with scientists and professors from WUR. Having said that scientists from Wageningen UR also help and support us in our approach. We also have an intern from biotechnology group of WUR.

We later converted the business model canvas to an operating model. See the following picture for this model (also in Dutch):
